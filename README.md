### Linking to Gates from Notes

You can also open a new Gate from within a note. By using the `obsidian://opengate` protocol.

#### Open pre-configured Gate

You can use a link in your notes to open a configured UI Gate and optionally open a specific URL in that Gate.

By default, the plugin will find the first Gate that matches the title or URL provided.

```markdown
Example 1: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs".
Will simply open the gate as configured.

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=googledocs)

```

Sometime, you want to change the url of the configured gate. You can do that by adding `url` parameter to the link.

```markdown
Example 2: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs" and go to a specific document.
Will navigate to the provided URL in the "googledocs" Gate.
Note: The original URL is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/abc123/edit but has been URL Encoded

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=google&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2Fabc123%2Fedit)
```

The gate will have them same configuration as the one you configured in the settings, but the url will be changed to the one you provided.

#### Open a temporary Gate

If no Gate is found, the plugin will open a temporary Gate with the provided URL, this gate will not be saved and will be deleted when you close it. To prevent multiple temporary Gates from being opened, which can lead to performance issues like Chrome tabs, the plugin only allow you to open one temporary Gate at a time.

The usage is exactly the same as the pre-configured Gate, but you no need to match the title or url.

#### Convert link

Select a link in your note, then right click and select `Convert to Gate Link`. The plugin will convert the link to a Gate link.

If the link is already a Gate link, the plugin will convert it back to a normal link.


## Usage: Code Block

You can use a code block with the language set to `gate` to embed any website directly within a note, including custom css.

````markdown
```gate
url: https://12bit.vn
height: 300
zoomFactor: 1
css: |
   html { filter: invert(90%) hue-rotate(180deg)!important; }
```
````

zoomFactor: 1 means 100% zoom, 0.5 means 50% zoom, 2 means 200% zoom.

## FAQ

### How to quickly insert a gate link?
